AES Pre-expanded Key

This example shows how to use pre-expanded keys to encrypt some plaintext,
and then decrypt it back to the original message.  Using pre-expanded keys
avoids the need to perform the expansion at run-time.  This example also
uses cipher block chaining (CBC) mode instead of the simpler ECB mode.
