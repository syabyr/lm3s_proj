CAN FIFO mode example

This application uses the CAN controller in FIFO mode to communicate with
the CAN device board.  The CAN device board must have the can_device_fifo
example program loaded and running prior to starting this application.
This program expects the CAN device board to echo back the data that it
receives and this application will then compare the data received with the
transmitted data and look for differences.  This application will then
modify the data and continue transmitting and receiving data over the CAN
bus indefinitely.

\note This application must be started after the can_device_fifo example
has started on the CAN device board.
