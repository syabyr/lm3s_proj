USB Audio Device

This example application makes the evaluation board a USB audio device
that supports a single 16 bit stereo audio stream at 48 kHz sample rate.
The application can also receive volume control and mute changes and apply
them to the sound driver.  These changes will only affect the headphone
output and not the line output because the audio DAC used on this board
only allows volume changes to the headphones.

The USB audio device example will work on any operating system that
supports USB audio class devices natively.  There should be no addition
operating system specific drivers required to use the example.   The
application's main task is to pass buffers to the  the USB library's audio
device class, receive them back with audio data and pass the buffers on to
the sound driver for this board.
