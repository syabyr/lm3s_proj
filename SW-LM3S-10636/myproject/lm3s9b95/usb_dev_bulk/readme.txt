USB Generic Bulk Device

This example provides a generic USB device offering simple bulk data
transfer to and from the host.  The device uses a vendor-specific class ID
and supports a single bulk IN endpoint and a single bulk OUT endpoint.
Data received from the host is assumed to be ASCII text and it is
echoed back with the case of all alphabetic characters swapped.

A Windows INF file for the device is provided on the installation CD.  This
INF contains information required to install the WinUSB subsystem on
WindowsXP and Vista PCs.  WinUSB is a Windows subsystem allowing user mode
applications to access the USB device without the need for a
vendor-specific kernel mode driver.  The device driver may also be
downloaded from http://www.luminarymicro.com/products/software_updates.html
as part of the ``Stellaris embedded USB drivers'' package
(SW-USB-windrivers).

A sample Windows command-line application, usb_bulk_example, illustrating
how to connect to and communicate with the bulk device is also provided.
The application binary is installed as part of the ``Windows-side examples
for USB kits'' package (SW-USB-win) on the installation CD or via download
from http://www.luminarymicro.com/products/software_updates.html .  Project
files are included to allow the examples to be built using Microsoft
VisualStudio.  Source code for this application can be found in directory
StellarisWare/tools/usb_bulk_example.
