Ethernet with lwIP

This example application demonstrates the operation of the Stellaris
Ethernet controller using the lwIP TCP/IP Stack.  DHCP is used to obtain
an Ethernet address.  If DHCP times out without obtaining an address,
AUTOIP will be used to obtain a link-local address.  The address that is
selected will be shown on the OLED display.

The file system code will first check to see if an SD card has been plugged
into the microSD slot.  If so, all file requests from the web server will
be directed to the SD card.  Otherwise, a default set of pages served up
by an internal file system will be used.
